## G7 Product Ideas
Identifying and Developing great ideas is G7's highest priority. **ALL** ideas submitted are considered; **NO EXCEPTIONS.** It does not matter how experienced you are, where you come from, how famous you are or how many Twitter followers you have, **we want to hear from you**.

The G7 team considers, aggregates and distills ideas into potential products that can be rapidly converted into an opensource specification.


This guideline describes:
* [What is a Product Idea and how you should formulate it](#what-is-a-product-idea)
* [How an idea is proposed or submitted to G7](#how-to-submit-a-product-idea)
* [How an idea is developed or shaped by G7 and you](#how-an-idea-is-developed-or-shaped-by-G7-and-you)
* [How an idea is selected for specification and further development by G7](#how-an-idea-is-selected-for-specification-and-further-development)

**NOTE:** A product idea can be a service if it's scalable.

### What is a Product Idea
A product idea is when a person(s) identifies a problem, identifies an inefficiency or identifies an opportunity within a market, an industry, an eco system, an organization or in society as a whole **AND PROPOSES AN ACTIONABLE SOLUTION.**
The idea attempts to diagnose the situation so that the focus is on the problem, not just its symptoms. [ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS](https://asq.org/quality-resources/root-cause-analysis) can be used to get to the root of a problem. 

Here are the 5 steps to developing your idea **BEFORE** submitting it to G7.
* **Problem Identification:** In this process, the team first has to solve one of our society’s problems. So, it needs to recognize a problem and why people will consume or use it. While several other products don’t give solutions to the problem but your product will. Defining a problem is thus, vital. A good resource for problem identification is the [FISHBONE DIAGRAM](https://asq.org/quality-resources/fishbone).


* **Product Overview:** Now you need to define the idea in a more detailed way and more from the intended users side and what they think is useful. Four components shape the core of the product overview: 
  * Uniqueness of the product.
  * The product features.
  * Benefits of the product.
  * The target audience.
  

* **Use Cases:** After defining the product overview you must define the individual use cases using [USER STORIES](https://adamfard.com/blog/user-stories). How will your intended users expect your product to work? What features will they expect to be included?


* **Product Design:** It includes a rough draft or sketch of the product appearance, a basic list or description of the functional requirements, the hardware requirements, the software requirements, the mechanical requirements and the dependencies of the product.


* **Product Benefits at Scale:** If this is built and goes to market, what benefits will society gain from this product. What's the vision.. the big picture.

### How an idea is developed or shaped by G7 and you
The G7 team will meet to discuss / shape the idea as you have submitted it. The team will create a shared, working document where recommendations and changes can be made. Your idea is evaluated and tested for the following qualities:
* **Unique:** What is / are the most important feature(s) that is / are unique to your idea.
* **Competition:** Are the core features already available in another product?
* **Viability:** Viability measures how long (duration) it will work for and how successful it will be.
* **Feasibility:** Feasibility measures how easy or difficult it is to achieve or to do something.
* **Utility:** How useful the idea really is. Is there a need?
* **Scalability:** How many people would benefit?

### How an idea is selected for specification and further development
Once the idea is distilled into it's core feature set and evaluated for the above qualities, the idea is scored by the G7 team. The scores are added to the working document. This working document is combined with your original documentation and submitted to the G7 community at large.
The G7 community will vote on whether the idea will be converted to an official specification. Everyone involved is notified within 24 hours of the final decision.
